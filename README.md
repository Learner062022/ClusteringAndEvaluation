# ClusteringAndEvaluation

## Description

A Jupyter notebook that covers the performance and knowledge requirements for ICTDAT503 - Use unsupervised learning for clustering.

## Usage

This project is intended for educational and practical applications in unsupervised learning, focusing on clustering techniques.

## Why This Project is Useful

This project demonstrates methodologies for clustering unlabeled data. It begins with normalization and standardization techniques to preprocess the data, ensuring that features are on comparable scales, which improves the performance of clustering algorithms. It includes:

- **K-Means Clustering**: Application of K-Means clustering on various datasets, including image data, to group similar features and reduce high-dimensional data into distinct clusters.
- **Evaluation and Interpretation**: Guidance on interpreting and evaluating clustering results by analyzing cluster centroids, assessing intra-cluster separation, and using metrics such as the silhouette score and elbow method to validate the clusters' quality.

## Getting Started

To run this notebook, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.12 or later
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (listed in the notebook)

Clone the repository and open the Jupyter notebook in your local environment:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
jupyter notebook <notebook-file>.ipynb
```
