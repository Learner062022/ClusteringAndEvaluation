# ClusteringAndEvaluation

## Description

A jupyter notebook combining parts of the performance and knowledge evidence requirements for ICTDAT503 - Use unsupervised learning for clustering.

## Usage

The project is intended for educational and practical applications in unsupervised learning, with a focus on clustering techniques. 

## Why This Project is Useful

Demonstrates methodologies for clustering unlabelled data, beginning with normalization and standardization techniques to preprocess the data, ensuring that features are on comparable scales and thus improving the performance of clustering algorithms. It covers the application of K-Means clustering across various data sets, including image data, by grouping similar features and reducing high-dimensional data into distinct clusters. Additionally, the notebook includes guidance on interpreting and evaluating clustering results, focusing on analyzing cluster centroids, assessing intra-cluster seperation, and utilizing metrics such as the silhouette score and elbow method to validate the clusters' quality.
